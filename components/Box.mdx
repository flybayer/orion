# Box

Box is your general purpose flexbox `div`. Always use it instead of a plain div. Box preserves the default `flex-direction: row;`, but if you prefer the default to be `column`, you can easily change it in `defaultProps` after it's installed in your project.

## Examples

<Playground>
  <Box border={1}>
    <Box width="2rem" height="2rem" bg="green.4" m={2}>
      1
    </Box>
    <Box width="2rem" height="2rem" bg="blue.4" m={2}>
      2
    </Box>
  </Box>
</Playground>
