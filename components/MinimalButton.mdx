# MinimalButton

For when you need a button, but you don't want it to be a bulky button. You want it to just blend in a bit, but still obviously be a button when you touch or hover your mouse over it.

## Examples

<Playground>
  <MinimalButton>Default</MinimalButton>
</Playground>

## Source Code

<Source />
