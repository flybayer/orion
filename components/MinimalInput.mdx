# MinimalInput

For when you need a button, but you don't want it to be a bulky button. You want it to just blend in a bit, but still obviously be a button when you touch or hover your mouse over it.

## Examples

<Playground>
  <MinimalInput placeholder="Favorite person" />
  <Box bg="blue.lighter" p={3} mt={3}>
    <MinimalInput placeholder="Works with colored background" />
  </Box>
</Playground>
