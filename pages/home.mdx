### Component libraries are great but, *what happens when you need to override some styles or behavior?*

Most likely you go into a dark room and engage in some hacky CSS overrides or node_modules monkey-patching. Woo hoo! It works. Well, at least until the next component library update. Then you have to fix it all over again :(

After experiencing that a few times, I built my own base components for each project. I soon realized I was copy and pasting the same base components to each new project I started. And then I had an idea...

*What if I had a command line tool to easily install my base components directly into any project?!*

That'd be amazing! I could use a component library without importing from npm and dealing with limitations. Anytime I need to change a style or behavior, I just edit the source right in my project's file system.


### Guiding Principles

- Ready out of the box for 80% of usecases but easily modified for the rest
  - Example: default adds margin between sequential `<Text>` blocks
- Based on real world physics
- Accessible
- Blazing performance
- Friendly

### Works With
- `styled-components`
- `emotion`


### FAQ

**But how do you handle updates?**

My opinion is component libraries shouldn't automatically update or change the styles in your app. Since Orion's components are presentational, there is no behavior to update or fix. If you encounter a style issue, you can easily check the lastest Orion source and manually port any changes.
