Most component libraries have a significant limitation â€” _what happens when you need to override some styles or behavior?_

Most likely you go into a dark room and engage in some hacky CSS overrides or node_modules monkey-patching. Woo hoo! It works. Well, at least until the next library update. Then you have to fix it all over again :disappointed:

Camber takes a different approach. Read on to see how. :arrow_down:

## Zero Dependency

Instead of installing from npm, you install the source code of Camber components directly into your project's repository. From there you can fully customize to your heart's content.

The brilliance of this approach is you then fully own the source code for your components. No need to worry about npm updates or breaking changes. Whew!

While Camber works great for installing the whole kit and caboodle, _you can also install components individually_ for a choose-your-own-adventure.

Now we call this zero dependency but just as _serverless_ still has servers, Camber does add some dependencies. Namely `styled-components` or `emotion` along with `styled-system`. But the kicker is these will be added to your project.json where you are fully in control. Camber is never listed in your package.json.

## Componentized Styles with CSS-in-JS

Most people have been bitten in the butt by the CSS cascade. These problems occur because regular CSS is like using global variables in your code. It's ok for few things but not for everything!

The brilliance of CSS-in-JS is you encapsulate styles on a component basis. Anytime you want to use a certain style, you use its component instead of concocting the right combination of CSS classes.

Additionally with CSS-in-js, instead of making CSS classes, you only make components. What? No more coming up with class names?! That's right! Also, as with any React component, you can extend components to inherit base styles.

Camber works with two popular CSS-in-JS libraries, [styled-components](https://styled-components.com) and [emotion](https://emotion.sh/). Both have comparable APIs so it's easy to swap one for the other. Camber then uses [styled-system](http://jxnblk.com/styled-system/) to add utility-first style props.

See [Christopher Chedeau's talk from 2014](https://vimeo.com/116209150) for more on how CSS-in-JS improves upon global stylesheets.

## Utility-First Style Props

We agree with [Tachyons](https://tachyons.io) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) that a utility-first API is freakin' amazing!

The brilliance of utility-first is the ability to fine-tune and tweak style and layout for various components right in your markup (HMTL/JSX) without writing additional, one-off CSS rules. And you get all that while keeping a sane, clean CSS architecture.

Here's an example showing what utility-first CSS looks like in practice.

```
// Tailwind CSS
<div class="flex sm:flex-col md:flex-row">
  This content is a column on mobile but a row on desktop
  <div class="mt-2">This has a 0.5rem top margin</div>
</div>

// Camber
<Box flexDirection={['column', 'row']}>
  This content is a column on mobile but a row on desktop
  <Box mt={2}>This has a 0.5rem top margin</Box>
</Box>
```

See [Adam Wathan's blog post](https://adamwathan.me/css-utility-classes-and-separation-of-concerns/) for a more in-depth exploration on why this is awesome.

## Amazing Cross-Platform UX

The web is broken. That means people who write CSS have to write long, scary rules to remove obnoxious things from some browsers and add things to others. Camber does all this for you.

Camber removes the need for something like [normalize.css](https://github.com/necolas/normalize.css) because Camber components include the neccesary (and boring) normalizing styles in each component as needed.

The severest offender you see in the wild is not removing hover styles on touch devices. You are a victim to this each time you have to tap twice to follow a link. The first tap shows the hover style; the second activates the link. Camber properly handles this out of the box.

Another subtle but important detail is Camber disables the default iOS gray overlay when touching a button. Instead, Camber shows the same thing as clicking the button, typically a `scale(0.97)`.

## Consistent But Flexible Design System

You can think of Camber as a design system starter kit. It has good defaults for all the basics and is ready for you customize to your brand identity.

The spacing and typography scales are both based on a geometric progression.

```
const space = [0, "0.25rem", "0.5rem", "0.75rem", "1rem", "1.5rem", "2rem", "3rem", "4rem", "6rem", "8rem", "12rem", "16rem", "24rem", "32rem", "40rem", "48rem"]
const fontSizes = [12, 14, 16, 21, 28, 38, 50, 66, 88, 117]
```

The default colors are from [Open Color](https://yeun.github.io/open-color/), a fantastic open-source color scheme for UIs.

This design system is baked into the Camber component API thanks to [styled-system](http://jxnblk.com/styled-system/).

## Design for the most common use case

## Fully Customizable

Fully developmed component library ready for you to customize to the look and feel you want.

## Truly Accessible

Camber uses proper semantic elements i.e. button are buttons, not divs. But this is the easy stuff!

For interactive components like modals and dropdown menus, Camber uses [Reach UI](https://ui.reach.tech/) which is proffesionally developed and tested for use with screen readers. Talk about standing on the sholders of giants!

## FAQ

**But how do you handle updates?**

My opinion is component libraries shouldn't automatically update or change the styles in your app. Since Camber's components are presentational, there is no behavior to update or fix. In case of major API changes to styled-components or styled-system, you can check the latest Camber source and port the neccesary changes to your project.
