# Orion
<Heading>A Component Library Generator for React</Heading>

Works with:
- `styled-components`
- `emotion`


### Project Principles

1. Feel like native controls
2. Based on real world physics
3. Accessible out of the box
4. Blazing performance
5. Friendly
6. Ready out of the box for 80% of usecases but easily modified for the rest
  1. Example: default adds margin between sequential `<Text>` blocks
