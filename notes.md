### UI Component libraries are great but, *what happens when you need to override some styles or behavior?*

Most likely you go into a dark room and engage in some hacky CSS overrides or node_modules monkey-patching. Woo hoo! It works. Well, at least until the next component library update. Then you have to fix it all over again :(

After experiencing that a few times, I built my own base components for each project. I soon realized I was copy and pasting the same base components to each new project I started. And then I had an idea...

*What if I had a command line tool to easily install my base components directly into any project?!*

That'd be amazing! I could use a component library without importing from npm and dealing with limitations. Anytime I need to change a style or behavior, I just edit the source right in my project's file system.

## Guiding Principles

- Amazing UX on all browsers and devices, including proper touch support
- Streamlined for the 80% use-case — Ex: add margin between `<Text>` blocks by default
- Truly Accessible — buttons are buttons, not divs
- Interactions are based on real world physics
- Blazing fast performance
- Support multiple themes and css-in-js libraries
